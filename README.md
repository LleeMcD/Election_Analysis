## Challenge  Overview
The purpose of the the election audit was to assist Tom,  a Colorado Board of Elections employee, with an election audit of the tabulated results for a US congressional precinct in Colorado. This task is ususally done in Excel. However, Tom's manager has asked if there's a way to automate the process using python. If the successfully performed with Python, the program code will be used to audit not only other congressional districts but also senatorial districts and local elections. The task is to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race.

#### Voting Methods
There were three primary voting methods for the election, which were as follows:
- Mail in ballots, which are typically counted in the central office.
- Punch cards, which are collected and fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and     sends the results to the centeral office.
- Direct recording electronic (DRE) counting machines are sent to the central office and     read by a computer.

Findings were requested for:
- The total number of that were votes cast.
- The total number of votes for each candidate.
- The percentage of votes for each candidate.
- The winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Challenge Summary
The project files and python code was stored in a GitHub repository. Some of the benefits of using the repository for the project were:
- Easy access by multiple contributors.
- Versioning, to prevent files and scripts from accidently being overwritten. 
- Security to prevent others from corrupting the project files.
